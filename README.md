Arrange the numbers in square matrix in ascending order..

This is my first project on GitHub. 

A 3*3 matrix has numbers from 1 to 15 dispersed in any order. You are required to arrange the numbers
in ascending order using arrow keys as described below:

 Key       Direction
  2          Down
  4          left
  6          right
  8          up
 
This game is in the beginning stage. To make it compatible across all machines, arrow keys need to be 
used for choosing the direction. 

This game is developed in C programming language using DevC++ editor.

Please feel free to provide your feedback.

Thanks.
